* Overview

=pyelas= is a thin SWIG Python wrapping of the efficient large-scale stereo matching library, [[http://www.cvlibs.net/software/libelas/][libelas]].

* Status

The [[https://github.com/jlowenz/pyelas/blob/master/src/demo.py][demo.py]] script works; passing two stereo image paths on the command line will display the resulting disparity map.

* Getting Started

Download the repository and enter the =src= directory.

  $ git clone http://github.com/jlowenz/pyelas.git
  
  $ cd src 
  
  $ python setup.py build_ext -i

You should then be able to run =demo.py <path to left> <path to right>=, or iPython and =import elas=. 

* Requirements

=pyelas= requires SWIG 3.0, Python (2.7), and numpy.

* License

=libelas= is licensed under the GPL, therefore this software is under the GPL as well. Please see the [[https://github.com/jlowenz/pyelas/blob/master/readme.txt][original readme]] for more information.
